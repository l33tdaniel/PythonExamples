import json

# a Python object (dict):
x = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}

# convert into JSON:
y = json.dumps(x)

# the result is a JSON string:
print(y)

Thanks to /Lukasa for that answer
JSON is a serialization format. 
That is, JSON is a way of representing structured data in the form of a textual string.

A dictionary is a data structure. 
That is, it is a way of storing data in memory that provides certain abilities to your code: 
in the case of dictionaries, those abilities include rapid lookup and enumeration.
